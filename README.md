================
Given a text file with a triangle of integers, the function max_path_sum
returns the maximum sum of adjacent numbers along a path moving down
the triangle.

For example, by starting at the top of the triangle and moving to
adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom
is 27.

         5
       9   6
     4   6   8
   0   7   1   5
  
I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.
